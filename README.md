machine learning projects
For this project, I worked with real Airbnb data to figure out if a listing lets you book it right away without waiting for host approval. I cleaned up the data, explored it to understand what’s going on, and then used a logistic regression model to make predictions.

Along the way, I didn’t just look at accuracyI also checked the F1 score and confusion matrix to make sure my model was actually doing a good job. Since the data was a bit unbalanced (some types of listings showed up more than others), using just accuracy would’ve been misleading.

This project was part of my Break Through Tech machine learning course, and it really helped me see how important it is to understand your data before jumping into modeling.
